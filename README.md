# product-demand-prediction
This code uses random forest regression to predict the unit demand of over 2000 products on a day-to-day basis. The data is fairly large with > 1M rows, but relatively few features, which results in weak predictability at the demand extremes. In real business terms, the poor predictabiltiy of very large demands (>3000 units) means the model isn't helpful for the largest and most important orders. Nonetheless, the implemtation of this model serves as a reasonable predictor of demand for the majority of the unit orders with a Spearman rho value of 82%, which could facilitate supply chain management for most of the products. The flask API enables the code to be deployed and receive data posts via Postman to the following address: http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict.

Input of the made up test data {"Product_Code":1410, "Year":2015, "Month":5, "Day":19, "Dayofweek":1} results in a prediction of 3812 units for Product Code 1410.
