# product-demand-prediction
This code uses random forest regression to predict the unit demand of over 2000 products on a day-to-day basis. The data is fairly large with > 1M rows, but relatively few features, which results in weak predictability at the demand extremes. In real business terms, the poor predictabiltiy of very large demands (>3000 units) means the model isn't helpful for the largest and most important orders. Nonetheless, the implemtation of this model serves as a reasonable indicator of predicting demand for the majority of the unit orders with Spearman rho value of 82%, which could facilitate supply chain management for most of the products.
